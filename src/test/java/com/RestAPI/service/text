If Athlete has added 6ft 1 1/8in height

When we export the sheet we are getting 73.125 that is fine

when we upload this sheet in Dashr - Dashr picks only 2 digits after deciaml
so it will round of 73.125 into 73.13 but in our kb3 system we dont have 73.13
so our calculation will convert this 73.13 into 73.25 that will become = 6ft 1 1/4
