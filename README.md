# Spring Boot Rest API With Exception Handling, Response Handling, and Unit Testing With JUnit5

## Introduction
This project demonstrates building a RESTful API using Spring Boot with features like exception handling, response handling, and unit testing. It includes integration with a MySQL database using Spring Data JPA, and utilizes technologies such as Mockito, AssertJ, JUnit 5, and H2 database for testing purposes.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Mockito
- AssertJ
- MySQL Database
- JUnit 5
- H2 Database
- Exception Handling
- Response Handling
- Spring Data JPA

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- **Main Application Class**: `RestApiApplication.java`
- **Controller**: Contains endpoints for handling HTTP requests (`EmployeeController.java`)
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic (`EmployeeService.java`, `EmployeeServiceImpl.java`)
- **Repository Layer**: Provides access to the database using Spring Data JPA (`EmployeeRepository.java`)
- **Model**: Contains data models (`Employee.java`)
- **Exception Handling**: Custom exceptions and exception handler (`EmployeeNotFoundException.java`, `NoEmployeesFoundException.java`, `EmployeeExceptionHandler.java`)
- **Response Handling**: Response handler for consistent API responses (`ResponseHandler.java`)
- **Unit Tests**: Test cases for controllers, services, and exception handling using Mockito, AssertJ, and JUnit 5

## Running the Application
1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure the MySQL database connection in `application.yaml`.
3. Run the application using Maven or an IDE.
4. Use tools like Postman or cURL to make API requests.

## Running Tests
1. Unit tests can be run using the Maven command: `mvn test`.
